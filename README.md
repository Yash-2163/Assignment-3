# Assignment 3: Branching Strategies and Merge Conflicts

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to practice using GitHub Flow by working with branches, making conflicting changes, and resolving a merge conflict.

## Summary
This project includes:
- A basic HTML file (`index.html`)
- Two feature branches:
  - Branch `A` : `feature/update-styling`: Updated the styling using Tailwind CSS
  - Branch `B` : `feature/add-content`: Added new content to the page
- A conflict caused by editing the same file in both branches
- Manual resolution of the conflict and successful merging of both branches

## Steps Completed
1. Created a new GitHub repository.
2. Built a simple HTML page.
3. Created two branches from `main`:
   - One for styling changes
   - One for adding content
4. Made and committed changes to both branches.
5. Opened pull requests for both.
6. Merged the styling branch first.
7. Faced a merge conflict when merging the content branch.
8. Manually resolved the conflict and completed the merge.

The conflict occurred because both branches modified the same part of the file. Git marked the conflict with special symbols. I manually edited the file to include changes from both branches, removed the conflict markers, tested the result, and committed the final version.

## What I Learned
- Merge conflicts are common when multiple branches change the same file.
- Manual resolution helps keep all important changes.
- Using GitHub Flow makes collaboration more organized.
